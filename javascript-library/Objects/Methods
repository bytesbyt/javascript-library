/*
When the data stored on an object is a function we call that a method. A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does.

For example console is a global JavaScript object and .log() is a method on that object. Math is also a global JavaScript object and .floor() is a method on it.

We can include methods in our object literals by creating ordinary, colon-separated key-value pairs. The key serves as our methodâ€™s name, while the value is an anonymous function expression.

With the new method syntax introduced in ES6 we can omit the colon and the function keyword.
